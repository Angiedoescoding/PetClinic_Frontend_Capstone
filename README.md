# Front-end of "Paws and Claws" Veterinary Clinic 

<p>Paws and Claws is a web application built with React (using Vite technology) for a veterinary clinic (as a part of the school project). It allows users to view information about the clinic's doctors, services, and animal care resources. The application also provides a modal for booking appointments.</p>
<p>The information about the clinic's doctors and services is fetched from [this file] (https://github.com/Angiedoescoding/PetClinic_Backend_Capstone). </p>
